# Whatstats
Little tool that gives some statistics on a WhatsApp conversation.

This simple project allows you to get some simple statistics regarding a Whatsapp conversation.

First off, you need to export a Whatsapp chat by using the "Email chat" option that can be found in the conversation menu.
Then you simply need to open the index.html page, load the file using the button and you will get your statistics!

More stats and better graphics will be implemented soon.
